events behind the scenes.

we know in call stack Global exectuion context will excute the code line by line.

but what happens with events?

as we know js is single thereaded, so it Cannot keep waiting till the event is triggered by the user. 
so it will take the help of browser, in browser we have web Api environemnt, it helps our js engine it let know
the js engine when the event is fired along with the event information.

 if the events are triggered than it will keep the triggered events in callback queue, these events are ready to 
 be executed.

 between the callback queue and call stack we have one wonderful thing `event loop`
  which monitor the call stack whether it is emptied or not. if the call stack emptied than eventloop places our
  events which are in callback queue in the call stack and they will start executing.

  -like this js will never waits and stops the exectuion for event to be triggered.
