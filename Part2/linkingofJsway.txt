In head:
<script src="./script.js"></script>

- if we link this way, when exectuion come to this line html file, the html Parsing will be stopped and the script
will start loading and once it's loaded it's start exectuing. so there are chances to get errors with improper
Parsing.

in body at last:
<script src="./script.js"></script>
- if we link the file at last, our pasrsing will be completed but it still it require time to load and exectuing.

using async:
<script src="./script.js" async></script>

- By using this the js file will be loaded while html Parsing , but here once js file line exectuion started
the js file will be loaded and Parsing will continue. But if, loading is completed before Parsing the pasrsing will
be stopped and loaded js file will start exectuing which is not ideal and may result in error.

using defer

<script src="./script.js" defer></script>

By using this the js file will be loaded while html Parsing , but here once js file line exectuion started
the Parsing will not stop, and js will load and Parsing will also take place. only after Parsing completed
the js file start exectuing
